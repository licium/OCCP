# Open Content Certification Protocol (OCCP)

See the [whitepaper](occp-whitepaper-2020-09-02.pdf) for a detailed documentation.

The Open Content Certification Protocol (OCCP) provides a description of the process and involved technologies that can be used by creative individuals, media organisations or consumers to generate or verify certificates for digital media content. 
Content certificates allow creative individuals, media organisations and other rightsholders to inseparably and verifiably connect information, basic metadata, licensing terms and other rights management information to digital content.

Organisations can act as certification authorities and formally attest the attribution of a rightsholder to the content and associated assertions or claims by means of only one blockchain transaction. With a simple blockchain transaction certifiers openly testify that they are aware of the identity of their creative clients and formally acknowledge them as rightsholders to the content. 
It is the goal of the certification process to create trust in assertions, claims and the authenticity of the original content, and to ensure accountability of the rightsholder, even if he  must or prefers to remain pseudonymous.

Content Certificates are the result of the certification process. They are issued implicitly when a certification transaction is confirmed on a public blockchain network. Thus, content certificates are open, discoverable and verifiable by anyone online and accessible for individuals or systems, using software applications or APIs. 
Services and applications can process content certificates in an automated way so that their users can verify the authenticity of digital media content, the identity and attribution of rightsholders and their claims to the content by having access to the digital assets, only.
